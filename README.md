# Advent of Code 2024: My Solutions

This repository contains my code for the puzzles from Advent of Code 2024. All my solutions are written in Java.

The puzzle descriptions can be found at https://adventofcode.com/2024.
To run the code, you need the puzzle input (`input.txt`). It can be downloaded from the mentioned website after creating an account.

I did not include the puzzle inputs in this repository since the [About page](https://adventofcode.com/2024/about#faq_copying) of Advent of Code requests not to publish any puzzle inputs.
